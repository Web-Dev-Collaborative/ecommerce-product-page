## My process

### Built with

- React
- Tailwind CSS
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was my first Intermediate project, and I'm really excited about the stack that I used. It wasn't a really big project, but it was big enough for Tailwind CSS. I used Tailwind CSS before in a small project, however, this time around it was a completely different experience. Although, I like Tailwind CSS a lot, I don't think one can use it in each and every project. Sometimes, I want to take the control in my hands, and in that case styled-components come to help. In brief, a cool project, that helped me to know Tailwind better and decide in what type of project I'd like to use it in the future.

### Useful resources

- [My image slider](https://codesandbox.io/embed/nice-snyder-h46gsi?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark) - Before beginning this project, I just wanted to make a simple slider in React and plain CSS for some practice. So, if you need a reference, here's one.
